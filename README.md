<center><p class="p1"><b>hi! in this website i will be explaining how i was able to make an origami butterfly ^_^</b></p>

<center><p class="p1"><br>To make one, you must fold your 15 x 15 cm paper in half. unfold it, and fold it again in its opposite side.
Unfold once again, this time making a fold from corner to corner. And again, unfold. Naturally it will come together to make two triangles
front to back. Now, from one of these triangles, you will make two triangles by folding. Flip the paper, and lift the opposite side without
the two triangles.  Then fold the said opposite side to make a crease. After that it should start to look like a butterfly. Now, to shape it, 
fold it once again. And you are done!</br></p>

<center><p class="p1"><b>The usefulness of origami ☆ﾟ. * ･ ｡ﾟ</b></p>
<center><p class="p1"><br>Origami is the art of paper folding which is often associated with Japanese culture.
It is quite useful to modern society and plays a role in math and specially its branch, geometry.
Using rulers, compasses, and tools of the like is not the only way to make shapes. 
In origami, only paper is required for you to make one. 
And as I had just mentioned, making shapes out of paper is already a geometric idea itself. 
Origami has also been proven to enhance logical thinking, mental concentration and hand-eye coordination. 
There have also been theorems made about crease patters of origami models, such as Maekawa’s theorem. 
Origami artists use these theorems and different mathematical methods to be able to create more advanced origami models. 
Overall, origami is very practical and useful. But I also think that it is often overlooked upon and not a lot know how useful it actually is.</br></p>
